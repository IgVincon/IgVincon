- 👋 Hi, I’m @IgVincon, currently I'm working in a project which aims to improve the overall quality of the educational system
by processing data from a child development census evaluation (e.g.: predicting grade retention and developing strategies to reduce it). 
Link to the project: https://indi.psico.edu.uy/en
- 👀 These are the kind of problems I'm interested in and are the reason I changed my focus from a purely academic interest in psychology
to an applied one. Thus, helping in the decision-making processes and delivering results that can benefit society as a whole.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning data science and psychometry in order to better achieve my interest's. Specifically I'm working on improving my SQL skills.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on similar projects, and also willing to broaden my horizons to domains beyond psychology.
- 📫 You can reach me by my LinkedIn profile: https://www.linkedin.com/in/jirvincon/?locale=en_US
