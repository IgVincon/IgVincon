# 👋 Hi there, 
I’m @IgVincon, former research assistant transitioning to software development. Previously, I worked as a core team member of [INDI](https://www.ineed.edu.uy/socioemocional/experiencias/inventario-de-desarrollo-infantil-indi.html) (a national scale applied research project) as a research assistant doing data analysis with Python. This brought me closer to the development side of things and got drawn in by the use of problem-solving skills and the possibility of creating something from scratch. Currently working as a Configuration Engineer for an American IT company that provides services for the insurance sector.

My stack so far: ✔️
- Python, Java, Pascal (learned this one while doing Programming 101)
- SQL
- NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, scikit-learn, nltk
- Requests, Beautiful Soup
- Git
- Principles of Software Testing (black & white, positive & negative, edge cases, etc.)

Currently, I'm learning about: 🌱
- Frontend development (HTML, CSS, JS)
- Backend development (Django)

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on similar projects, and also willing to broaden my horizons.
