# 👋 Hi there, 
I’m @IgVincon, applied researcher in psychology and sole developer of [SIRS](https://github.com/IgVincon/sirs) (an ETL pipeline with some data journalism mixed into it). I have also worked as a core team member of [INDI](https://indi.psico.edu.uy/) (a national scale applied research project) as a research assistant doing data analysis. 

Currently, I'm learning about: 🌱
- Parallel processing
- Dashboarding
- NLP

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on similar projects, and also willing to broaden my horizons to domains beyond psychology in an interdisciplinary fashion.
